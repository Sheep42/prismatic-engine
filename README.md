# Prismatic Engine - By Unicorner Games

## Philosophy

Prismatic Engine is a simple game Engine for Panic's Playdate, built with their C API. 

The philosophy is to provide a boilerplate project that simplifies some of the crunchier aspects of C development on the Playdate and allows developers to start prototyping quickly. It aims to provide a layer between the developer and the Playdate API that allows you to focus on building your game and not on memory and state management.

Prismatic Engine has been designed with flexibility in mind. The Engine includes a Scene and Sprite Management system which handles its own memory management for faster development, but does not force you to use any of its internal tools. All of the Prismatic types also expose the underlying raw Playdate API types in order to take advantage of the work already done by the Playdate team.

The engine is built directly into the project, but separated into its own `prismatic` directory. This allows the developer to examine and/or modify core functionality as needed without getting in your way if you don't care to deal with the specifics.
