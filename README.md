# Prismatic Engine - By Unicorner Games

## Philosophy

Prismatic Engine is a simple game Engine for Panic's Playdate, built with their C API. 

The goal is to provide a boilerplate project that simplifies some of the crunchier aspects of C development on the Playdate and allows developers to start prototyping quickly.
